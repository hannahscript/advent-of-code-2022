# Advent of Code 2022

This year I am learning and using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). There were also plans to write a toy [forth-like](https://www.forth.com/forth) language that compiles to
[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org), but that was a little ambitious. I did get it working somewhat, though.
